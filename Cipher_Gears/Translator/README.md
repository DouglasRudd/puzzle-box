# Encrypting/Decrpyting messages

The setup for encrypting and decrypting messages involves two parts:
1. Placing the gears in the right spoke order (2, 4, 5), for example
1. Turning each gear individually to match a key of an equal number of letters to the number of gears used.

An example [can be found here](https://rawgit.com/rcalme/puzzle-box/master/Cipher_Gears/Translator/cipherGears.html) (random seed is set to the default in this code).

[cipher.py](cipher.py) is provided to encrypt and decrypt arbitrary messages. Use it as follows:
```
> ./cryptex.py --gears 2 4 6 --key YAY --seed 12345 --encrypt "This is a secret message"
JBHQ HQYQ TADH JUTQ VMFH

> ./cryptex.py --gears 2 4 6 --key YAY --seed 12345 --decrypt "JBHQ HQYQ TADH JUTQ VMFH"
THIS ISAS ECRE TMES SAGE
```

**NOTE:** providing a random seed overrides the default, and will result in generated letter 
combination on the gears that differ from those in this git project. Take care to modify those files
before cutting parts if you intend to use a different seed.

You can print the orientation of the letters on the gears generated by this utility by adding the `--show` flag:
```
> ./cryptex.py --gears 2 4 6 --key YAY --seed 12345 --decrypt --show "JBHQ HQYQ TADH JUTQ VMFH"
