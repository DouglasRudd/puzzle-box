# CNC Files

Depending upon your CNC, and software toolchain, you're likely to have to edit 
these files before you can send anything to your machine.

I cut this out of a maple board, because it's what I had on hand.

The initial dimensions were 5.5" wide, 0.75" thick, and 48" long.

The thickest parts are 0.5", so the first pass is to use a flycutter bit to plane 
down the surface. This makes sure that it's both flat, and the correct thickness.
